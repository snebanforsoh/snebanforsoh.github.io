### Work Experience
May 1 - September 30, 2019: Mining/Environmental Engineering internship, University of
Yaounde/Wakaso gold mine Adamawa-Cameroon
• Collected and sampled water and sediments in situ at a gold mine, upstream and downstream, and preserved
samples for further analysis
• Transported and carried out physicochemical analysis (turbidity, conductivity, suspended solids, heavy
metal concentrations, particle size analysis, infrared spectroscopy, etc.) on the samples collected and
interpretation of laboratory results.
• Created an eco-friendly coagulant used in water treatment and tested the coagulant's efficacy on the water
to devise a treatment method for the wastewater collected from the site and the nearby surface water.
• Analyzed water samples before and after treatment and interpreted the findings raising awareness among
the villagers of the dangers of polluted water.
August 1 - August 30, 2017: Mining Engineering internship, Dreamland Quarry, Bamenda, Cameroon
• Gained skills in the different activities carried out on the field and in the quarry, like marking and
measuring drilling holes and distance.
• Studied the phenomenon of explosives, the different types, their characteristics, precautions, and their
storage.
• Performed blasting operations after filling various holes with explosives and connecting them to the source.
• Identified the environmental effects of the drilling and blasting processes and suggested management
techniques.
June 10 - September 10, 2014: Environmental Engineering internship, international soap factory,
Bamenda, Cameroon
• Assisted in soap production (preparation of raw materials, mixing, boiling, cutting, and packaging.
• Guided various soap production processes, highlighting their various facets and potential environmental
effects, and helped create short- and long-term plans, budgets, and performance goals for environmental
programs.
• Collected and analyzed solid waste, managed liquid waste by recycling, and examined wastewater from
production processes.
• Designed and dimensioned an incinerator for solid waste.
June 1 - June 30, 2013: Environmental Engineering internship, MUPTAREC (Mushroom production and
transformation company), Bamenda, Cameroon
• Assisted in mushroom and mushroom juice production (preparation of the seeds and the substrate,
sterilization, planting, watering, harvesting, and drying).
• Participated in seminars, helped manage project data and calculations, and promoted mushroom juice sales.
• Conducted environmental field inspections of the entire property regularly and participated in
environmental inspections of the property by governmental agencies.
